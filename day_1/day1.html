			The <b>wolf</b> (<i>Canis lupus[a]</i>), also known as the <strong>gray wolf</strong> or <strong>grey wolf</strong>, 
			is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. <u>More than thirty 
			subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized,</u> and gray wolves, as 
			colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf 
			is the largest extant member of Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) 
			and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length 
			and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished 
			from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a 
			shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely 
			enough to smaller <cite>Canis</cite> species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, 
			to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually 
			mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic 
			region may be nearly all <strike>black</strike> white.

		<blockquote>
		Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative 
		game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, 
		its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. It travels 
		in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. 
		Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and 
		in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial 
		and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The 
		wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as 
		smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs 
		typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and 
		parasites, notably rabies, may infect wolves.
